Problem Statement
 As a Greenphire employee I would like to add my favorite 6
 numbers to consider for a Powerball entry ticket so that I
 can win 1 billion dollars.

How it works
 1) Run the program
 2) Follow the prompts to fill in you info
 3) If you want to add another employee type "y"
    If not type anything eles
 4) Review the employees and their picks
 5) View the winning number
